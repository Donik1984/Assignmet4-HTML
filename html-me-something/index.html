            <p class="MainArticle">
                There are several makes of cars that I like the most.
                They do have a very great history followed by rising and falls, victories and losses, great engineering decisions and failures.

                1968 Alfa Romeo Type 33 Stradale. There were built 14 Stradales based on the mid-engine Type 33 race car.
                The engine is a 2.0-liter 4-cam V8 with 230 horsepower, enabling a 0-60 time of 5.5 seconds.

            <p class="Text">
                For the 1968 Expo in Montreal, Alfa created a concept car that later went into production. Powered by a V8,
                the Montreal was never sold in the U.S., but you can find examples at today's car shows.

                The Lancia Stratos HF (Tipo 829), widely and more known simply as Lancia Stratos, is a sports car and rally car
                made by Italian car manufacturer Lancia. The HF stands for High Fidelity. It was a very successful rally car,
                winning the World Rally Championship in 1974, 1975 and 1976; and race car winning 1974 Targa Florio, five times
                the Tour de France Automobile and three editions of Giro d'Italia automobilistico.

            <h2>And the legendary "Lancia Delta Integrale""</h2>

            <p class="Text">
                The first generation Delta dominated the World Rally Championship during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
                The homologation requirements of Group A regulations meant marketing road-going versions of these competition
                cars — the Lancia Delta HF 4WD and HF Integrale. A total of 44,296 Integrales were produced.
